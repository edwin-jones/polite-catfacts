# polite-catfacts
This is my node rest api to provide polite catfacts. I've found that other apis can provide unpleasant facts so I've written my own to make sure every fact you get is _**nice!**_

I've hosted the api on Heroku so everybody can use it. Try it out with a [random cat fact.](https://polite-catfacts.herokuapp.com/catfact/)

You can read the documentation [here.](https://polite-catfacts.herokuapp.com/docs/)
